# Bitcoin Private
This is the only <a href="http://bitcoinprivate.org">official</a> repository for Bitcoin Private project.<br>
<br>
<b>Bitcoin Private</b> is being developed since 2015 and planned for launch in 2018-2019.<br>
<br>
It is a pure hardfork of Bitcoin codebase with all UTXO set of Bitcoin at a some certain block with private transactions feature added made possible by using zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKs). Bitcoin Private will have its own blockchain with <b>SegWit</b> activated and therefore <b>Lightning Network</b> onboard.<br>
<br>
Hardfork is planned to happen on the <b>block 550000</b>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>ATTENTION! Bitcoin Private</b> is not connected with <i>Zclassic (ZCL/BTCP)</i> scammers trying to hijack the name of Bitcoin Private from us and push their own project as a legitimate one.<br>
<br>
<b>Bitcoin Private</b> will be released no matter of any attempts to hijack the name.<br>
